# Magento-2-Store-Pickup

While ordering any product online, the customer is restless about getting the product in their hands soon. Sometimes the customers cannot wait till the product is shipped and received. The shipment and delivery process is a bit longer as it involves packaging, shipment, and delivery. And it also implies a shipping fee that the customer will never like to opt for if they have a physical store near their residence. To overcome this, MageComp has established Store Pickup Extension for Magento 2.
